## Good Development Practices

### First start with "npm init -y"

### Then install all the required packages in the dependencies and dev dependencies

### Now import those packages

### Create a config file to connect with db

### Create models for the schema to the users

### Create routes to do the actions

### For each action create seperate branch using the command "git checkout -b feature/get-users" similary for all the actions . At the end merge all the branches to main branch

### In index.js we need to call the routes, config

### In routes Call models , config

### Now create .env, .env.test.js,.env.production.js where these are the differnt environments to develop the code ,test the code and for production.

### To run the application npm run dev (for development). Similarly for npm run test(for testing), npm run production(for production)
